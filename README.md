## Election Audit Summary

This script can be used for any election with the correct data being collected and shared. Two examples for modifying our script to work for any election would be:
1) Modify the running State representatives for each specific State while being sure to modify the county votes based on how many counties there are total.
2) Additional demographic details can be collected to see if a certain candidate was more or less popular with certain groups of people. The script would require additional functionality while also requiring a more comprehensive CSV file.
